Oblique version of the Terminus font
--------------------------------------

This package contains oblique versions of the fonts in the package
xfonts-terminus.  These fonts are automatically generated and at
present are not supported by the upstream maintainer.  They have lower
quality than the original fonts.  Nevertheless they can be useful for
some programs such as GNU Emacs and XEmacs.
